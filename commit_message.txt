feat(frontend): Implement core ERP frontend with Product CRUD and Auth

This commit introduces the foundational frontend application for the UMKM Core ERP system.
It includes the following key features and improvements:

- **Initial Setup & Cleanup**:
  - Cleaned up boilerplate code and styles from Vite+React initial setup.
  - Established a clear component structure (`src/components`, `src/context`, `src/services`).

- **Authentication System**:
  - Implemented user login and logout functionality via `authService`.
  - Created `AuthContext` for global authentication state management.
  - Developed a dedicated `LoginPage` component with Material-UI.
  - Set up `ProtectedRoute` to secure application routes, redirecting unauthenticated users to login.

- **Core Product Management (CRUD)**:
  - **Product Listing (Read)**: Displays products in a Material-UI table, fetching data from `/api/v1/products`.
  - **Product Creation (Create)**: Introduced `ProductForm` for adding new products via `POST /api/v1/products`.
  - **Product Editing (Update)**: Developed `EditProduct` to pre-fill forms with existing product data and update via `PUT /api/v1/products/:id`.
  - **Product Deletion (Delete)**: Added delete functionality to `ProductList` with confirmation, using `DELETE /api/v1/products/:id`.
  - Integrated `productService` to centralize all product-related API interactions.

- **Application Structure & Navigation**:
  - Created a `Layout` component with a `Navbar` for consistent application structure.
  - Implemented `react-router-dom` for client-side routing, including protected routes.
  - Added a "Create Product" button in the `ProductList` view and associated routes.

- **UI/UX Enhancements**:
  - **Pagination**: Added `TablePagination` to `ProductList` for efficient display of large datasets, supported by `productService` updates.
  - **Snackbar Notifications**: Implemented a global `SnackbarContext` to provide user feedback (success/error messages) for all CRUD operations.

This commit establishes a robust and user-friendly foundation for further ERP module development.
